\begin_layout Section
The history of kidney transplantation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Early animal experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advancements in surgical methods and techniques at the beginning of the
 20th century eventually led to experiments with organ transplantation.
 On March 1st, 1902, Emerich Ullman, a physician at the Vienna Medical School,
 performed the first recorded organ transplantation.
 He performed an autograft, meaning the transplantation where the donor
 and the recipient are the same individual.
 Ullmann utilized the method of vascular suturing developed by Ervin Payr,
 to connect the dog's kidney to the vessels of its neck.
 The transplant was successful - the kidney produced urine.
 The dog was presented the same day to Vienna medical society eliciting
 significant interest and discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same year other similar transplantations were made.
 Another physician, Alfred von Decastello, performed a dog-to-dog kidney
 allograft at the Institute of Experimental Pathology in Vienna.
 The kidney produced urine for a while but then stopped working.
 Later Ullman performed a dog-to-goat kidney xenograft (cross-species transplant
), and to his surprise kidney produced some urine, but later stopped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Lyon in the department headed by Mathieu Jabourday, his assistants Carrel,
 Briau and Villard were working on new methods of vascular suturing.
 In 1902, Alex Carrel published the method of vessel anastomosis now referred
 to as Carrel's seam.
 This technique represented a significant improvement over existing methods
 and effectively addressed the common issues of thrombosis, hemorrhage,
 stricture, and embolism

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later Carrel moved to the United States where he continued his research
 on vessel suturing and organ transplantations at The Rockefeller Institute
 for Medical Research.
 There he perfected his method and while performing autografts and allografts
 documented what later would be recognized as ”rejection”.
 For his works in 1912, he got the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
 By this time, his method of suturing had been widely adopted in human surgeries

Early human transplantation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first recorded human renal xenograft
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset

 was performed by Mathieu Jaboulay in 1906.
 He chose a pig and a goat as donor animals and performed two xenografts.
 One kidney was transported to the arm and the second to the thigh.
 Each kidney functioned for one hour

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second and third human transplants performed by Ernst Unger were far
 more known.
 On December 10, 1909, he performed a kidney transplant from a stillborn
 baby to a baboon.
 Even though the kidney produced no urine, the postmortem showed that vascular
 anastomosis (connection of vessels) was performed successfully.
 This inspired Unger to perform another transplantation that same month,
 but this time monkey-to-human xenograft.
 The kidney was transplanted from an ape to dying from renal failure young
 woman.
 The kidney never worked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These early experiments demonstrated that technically kidney transplantation
 was possible, but the mechanism of rejection was not yet fully understood.
 Carrel in his famous lecture about the future of transplantation (1914)
 to the International Surgical Society mentioned that the works of his colleague
 at the Rockefeller center J.B.
 Murphy might seriously impact the development of the field.
 Murphy found that irradiation and benzol treatment increased the graft
 survival of cancer in mice.
 This observation inspired Carrel to conduct his own experiments, wherein
 he irradiated recipients and found prolonged graft survival, but these
 experiments were never formally published

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The period of the 1930s and 1940s was rather stagnant compared to the beginning
 of the century.
 European surgical centers that studied transplantology before were in decline.
 Moyo Clinic in the US was conducting some cautious experiments without
 considering Carrol's works and attempts at immunosuppression.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 However, there was a notable event during this period - the first human-to-huma
n transplantation.
 It was performed by Yurii Voronyi (in literature for some reason he is
 referred to as Voronoy) on March 3, 1933, in Kherson, Ukraine.
 The recipient was a 26-year-old woman admitted to the hospital on March
 3, 1933, with mercury chloride poisoning induced by a suicide attempt the
 previous day that resulted in acute renal failure.
 Transplantation seemed the only viable option.
 It was known from previous experiments by other scientists that no xenograft
 ever was successful so human-to-human transplantation was the only feasible
 choice.
 The option of injuring a living person by organ removal was not even considered.
 It was known from the physiology that kidneys save their function a couple
 of hours after the reperfusion with ringer-solution and that organs keep
 some sterility a couple of hours after the host's death.
 So temporary cadaver transplantation until the woman's own kidneys would
 regenerate seemed to be a reasonable option.
 The transplantation was performed to the thigh's artery and vein using
 Carrel's seam with some modifications.
 After some time the kidney started to produce urine for a while but then
 eventually the allograft failed and 48 hours after the surgery the patient
 dies.
 The reason for graft failure was blood group mismatch and too long warm
 ischemia time - 6 hours, so the kidney began to degrade, resulting in an
 immune reaction to dead kidney cells and kidney blood cells.
 Voronyi performed another 5 such transplantations, which he considered
 as a bridge therapy until the recipient's own kidneys would recover.
 Kidneys produced urine for different durations from 1 to 7 days with 2
 patients eventually recovering and living normally thereafter

\begin_layout Subsection
First successes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1946, at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, a group of surgeons:
 Hufnagel, Hume, and Landsteinerhuman performed kidney transplantation under
 local anesthetic on the arm vessels.
 The short period of kidney functioning may have helped the patient to recover
 from acute renal failure.
 It ignited the hospital's interest in renal transplantation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simonsen in Denmark, Dempster in London, and Küss in Paris concluded that
 it is preferable to place the kidney in the pelvis.
 Further, both Simonsen and Dempster deduced that the immune response was
 responsible for graft failure and both hypothesized that the humoral mechanism
 of rejection was probable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early 1950s, two groups of surgeons based in Paris and Chicago performed
 pelvic kidney transplants without immunosuppression.
 In Paris, Jean Hamburger reported the first live-related kidney transplant
 between a mother and her child.
 he transplanted kidney began to function immediately.
 It functioned for 22 days until it was rejected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A series of nine transplantations with the thigh position of the allograft
 was closely studied in Boston and the first usage of hemodialysis for the
 preparation was recorded in Boston by David Hume in 1953.
 In some of these cases, mild successes were achieved using the adrenocorticotro
pic hormone (more known as cortisone).
 It was hypothesized that the endogenous immunosuppression of uremia was
 responsible for the results rather than the drug regimen.
 Hume's findings were substantial as he concluded that prior blood transfusions,
 blood group matching between the donor and recipient, and host bilateral
 nephrectomy could be beneficial for the success of the transplant.
 These conclusions were later confirmed by subsequent studies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These attempts in the early 1950s taught technical aspects of kidney transplanta
tion and with increased confidence on December 23, 1954 in Boston Joseph
 Murray performed kidney allograft from one identical twin to another, bypassing
 the rejection barrier.
 From that time many similar surgeries were performed in Boston.
 This caused a lot of talks and predictions but all of them were negated
 when one of such recipients got pregnant and gave birth to a completely
 normal infant.
 However, in retrospective, it didn't bring anything new scientifically,
 because the technical possibilty of kidney transplantation was evident
 and the cases of successful skin allografts between identical twins were
 known for decades, but nonetheless it was an important milestone that aroused
 the interest in further experiments

\begin_layout Subsection
Attempts in immunosuppression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1948 at Mayo Clinic patients handicapped by rheumatoid arthrytis were
 given already mentioned cortisone, adrenal cortical hormone with mild immunosup
pressive properties, that relieved their condition.
 This popularized the research on adrenal cortical hormones, but later it
 was concluded that the steroid effect was clinically insignifficant for
 transplantation.
 After that, the experiments with irradiation, abandoned by Carrel and Murphy,
 were revitalized.
 Joan Main and Richmond Prehn showed that weakening of the immune system
 of adult mice by radiation and consequent skin and bone marrow transplantation
 from the same donor resulted in skin transplant acceptance.
 This encouraged teams in Boston and Paris to pursue the similar approach
 in humans.

In 1958, Murray’s team transplantation on humans utilizing the Main-Prehn
 method conducted lethal total body irradiation (TBI) on two patients with
 additional bone marrow transplant.
 Ten more recipients were irradiated with sub-lethal TBI, but without donor
 bone marrow transplant.
 As a result 11 patients passed away within a month, the only survivor had
 sub-lethal TBI without transplanted bone marrow and he got kidney from
 his non-identical twin brother.
 This was rather revolutionary - for the first time kidney was not rejected
 from non-identical twin.
 The kidney functioned for 20 years.
 Jean Hamburger and his team performed another fraternal twin transplant
 utilizing the same irradiation technique.
 The transplant functioned for 26 years finishing with the recipient's death
 for rejection-unrelated reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between 1960 and 1962 Kuss and Hamburger performed four successful transplantati
ons between non-twin patients with following TBI.
 This gave promise that the transplantations could be done in non-twins
 and potentially between anybody.
 The research continued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was obvious that TBI is not the best choice and that it is necessary
 to find a substitution.
 In 1959, Schwarz and Damesehek from Tufts University published paper that
 described how an anticancer drug 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) lowered immune
 response to foreign proteins in rabbits.
 Roy Calne, a training surgeon at Royal Free Hospital, London, dissapointed
 with TBI in prolongation of kidney allograft survival in dogs, noticed
 Schwarz and Dameshek's paper and performed his own experiment in dogs and
 found that it signifficantly prolonged dog's survival.
 Charles Zukoski and David Hume found the same outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6-MP was used in three tranplantations at Royal Free Hospital, but without
 success, However Kuss and assosiates reported one prolonged graft survival
 from a nonrelated donor.
 The TBI was main agent and intermittent usage of azathioprine and prednisone
 was used as an additional therapy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings provided Roy Calne with the 6-MP derivative
 - azathioprine.
 Calne showed even longer graft survival with azathioprine.
 Both Elion and Hitchings were awarded with the Nobel Prize for the development
 of 6-MP and azathioprine.
 In 1961 Azathioprine became available for human use.

Gloom then revolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1963 National Research Council organized a small conference constisting
 of 25 transplant clinitians and scientists to review the status of kidney
 transplantation at the moment.`the discussion was quite depresive.
 Clinitians presented their results, that were rather discouraging: less
 that 10% of hundreds performed transplantations survived for more than
 three months, from patients with TBI only six got to the one year mark.
 Murray reported that from his first ten patients on 6-MP one survived for
 a year, others passed away within 6 months, so it was concluded that drugs
 were not more effective than radiation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gloom continued untill Tom Starzl, until then unknown, did his presentation
 where he described his protocol that allowed graft survival for more than
 one year in 70% of cases.
 He was not believed at first, but then he showed medical records of his
 patients and he was eventually believed.
 The only thing that differed from other protocols with 6-MP was that addition
 of prednison.
 This was a sensation.
 In the first year after the presentation, 50 new tranplantation programs
 were founded in US alone.
 And his protocol became medical world standard for the next 20 years.

Plateau

\begin_layout Standard
During the period from 1964 to 1980 nothing groundbreaking had happened,
 although the steady development was seen.
 Dialysis become available and thanks to the acumulated exprerience the
 dosages became more precise.
 The brain death was accepted and the body was supported for a while to
 save organs for transplantation.

Hemodialysis for renal failure was created by Willem Kolff from Holland
 during WWII.
 But it couldn't be used for chronic renal failure untill 1960 when was
 invented Teflon arteriovenous conduits for long-term vascular access.

\begin_layout Standard
Acceptance of brain death as a real death.
 Before the mid 60s the kadaver transplantation was limited by the ischemic
 damage.
 Now the additional organs were available from

Cold for organ preservation.
 This was suggested in 1905 by Carrel's colleague Charles Guthrerie.
 Initially, Starzl used total body hypothermia to protect donor organs,
 but by 1960 switched to infusing cold solution into the portal vein to
 protect donor livers.
 In 1963 the infusion of cold solution intravenous in the transplanted kidney
 has become a standard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the organ preservation for more than 6 hours was achieved in mid 60s
 the exchange of organs between centers has became practical.
 Initially sharing was local and informal, that roused the worry that the
 organs could be distributed unequally and that they could be transported
 outside of the US.
 This led to Congress passing the National Transplant Act in 1984.
 The Southeastern Organ Procurement Foundation (SEOPF), founded in 1969
 and eventually composed of 12 hospitals in several cities, served as the
 template for the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) that controls organ
 allocation and placement, monitors performance of transplant centers and
 organ procurement organizations, collects data, and controls quality.
 UNOS has been a force for order and good, but to some its effectiveness
 has seemed compromised by the excessive scale of its tasks and the number
 and size of its committees and inevitable bureaucracy ( WRITE SOMETHING
 GOOD ABOUT THEM!!!)

Tissue typing (rename)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although tissue typing was suggested by Alexis Carrel in the beginning of
 20th century it could not be proven and used until 1958 when Jean Dausset
 discovered the first human leukocyte antigen (HLA).
 Testing for antibodies was not reliable until 1964 when Paul Terasaki invented
 a microxytotoxicity assay.
 Test included mixing donor's lymphocytes and recipient's serum and quickly
 has became the standard and was name crossmatch.
 For a couple of years Terasaki performed typing for most of U.S.
 transplant centers and found a couple of observations: 1) Positive cross-match
 test predicts hyperacute rejection.
 2) matching can reliably identify optimal donor within a family.
 It was assumed that the same would work for non-related recipients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when in 1970 Terasaki reviewed his large database of cadaver renal
 allografts he found no correlation with the typing.
 This raised a lot of agitation in tissue typing community and his grant
 even was temporalily suspended until others didn't report the same.
 Now it is conclded that the

Next mark was cyclosporine, a fungal derivative with immunosuppressive propertie
s discovered in 1976 by Jean-François Borel.
 It revolutionized the renal and extrarenal transplants, proving to be much
 better than the previous drug azathioprine.
 However it also had to be combined with prednisone to gain those results.
 It was used until 1989 when even more potent drug was discovered - Tacrolimus.
 It helps even when the cyclosporine with prednisone has no effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultimate goal is immunosuppression without drugs because drugs are often
 toxic and the proper dosing might be tricky.
